This package contains the Shader Graph and Material.

The shader was created in Unity 2022.3.46f1, but should work for all Unity versions onwards.
This shader requires the Unity Universal Render Pipeline (URP) to work!

To set up:
- Create a new Universal Render Pipeline Asset
- Under the 'Renderer' asset, click Add Renderer Feature
- Select 'Pixelate Feature'
- Apply the Pipeline asset to your projects Graphics settings.
- Done!
